- ✅ FTP/File Manager access to your Hostinger account
- ✅ The built application files (already prepared)
- ✅ Supabase project with Stripe integration (already configured)

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### Step 1: Prepare Production Build
The application is already built for production with Hostinger-optimized settings. The build includes:
- ✅ Stripe payment integration

- ✅ Subscription management
- ✅ Optimized for Hostinger Apache servers

### Step 2: Access Your Hostinger Account

1. **Login to Hostinger hPanel**
   - Go to: https://hpanel.hostinger.com/
   - Login with your Hostinger credentials

2. **Navigate to File Manager**
   - Click on "File Manager" in the hPanel dashboard
   - Navigate to `public_html` folder (this is your website root)

### Step 3: Upload Website Files

#### Option A: Using Hostinger File Manager
1. **Clear existing files** (if any) in `public_html`
2. **Upload all files** from the `/workspace/findbrexit-consultants/dist/` folder:
   ```
   📁 Files to upload:
   ├── index.html
   ├── .htaccess (CRITICAL for React routing)
   ├── robots.txt
   ├── sitemap.xml
   └── assets/ (entire folder with all JS/CSS files)
   ```

#### Option B: Using FTP Client (FileZilla, etc.)
1. **FTP Credentials** (find in hPanel → FTP Accounts):
   - Host: your-domain.com or IP address
   - Username: your FTP username
   - Password: your FTP password
   - Port: 21

2. **Upload Process**:
   - Connect to FTP
   - Navigate to `public_html/`
   - Upload all files from `dist/` folder

### Step 4: Configure Domain & SSL

1. **Domain Settings**:
   - Ensure **findbrexitconsultants.co.uk** points to your Hostinger servers
   - DNS should be managed by Hostinger nameservers

2. **Enable SSL Certificate**:
   - In hPanel → SSL → Enable free SSL for your domain
   - Force HTTPS redirect (should be automatic)

### Step 5: Configure Supabase CORS

1. **Login to Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `zjfilhbczaquokqlcoej`

2. **Update CORS Settings**:
   - Navigate to: Settings → API
   - In "CORS Settings", add your domain:
   ```
   https://findbrexitconsultants.co.uk
   https://*.findbrexitconsultants.co.uk
   ```

### Step 6: Update Stripe Webhook URL

1. **Access Stripe Dashboard**:
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com
   - Navigate to: Developers → Webhooks

2. **Update Webhook Endpoint**:
   - Find your existing webhook
   - Update URL to: `https://zjfilhbczaquokqlcoej.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`
   - Ensure these events are selected:
     - `customer.subscription.created`
     - `customer.subscription.updated`
     - `customer.subscription.deleted`
     - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
     - `invoice.payment_failed`

### Step 7: Test Deployment

#### Critical Tests to Perform:
1. **Website Loading**: Visit https://findbrexitconsultants.co.uk
2. **React Routing**: Test navigation (should work without 404 errors)
3. **Authentication**: Test sign up/sign in functionality
4. **Payment System**: 
   - Test subscription signup (use Stripe test mode)
   - Verify 14-day free trial workflow
   - Test customer portal access

#### Test Payment Flow:
1. Go to pricing page
2. Click "Start Free Trial" on any plan
3. Complete Stripe Checkout (use test card: 4242424242424242)
4. Verify subscription appears in dashboard
5. Test customer portal access
