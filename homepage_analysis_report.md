#### Available Authentication Features:
- **"List Your Business"** - Primary authentication/registration entry point
  - Located in both header navigation and footer
  - Designed for consultants/businesses wanting to join the platform
  - Likely leads to a registration/onboarding flow

4. **User Experience**: Focused on connecting businesses with consultants rather than user account management

## Summary

This website represents a B2B marketplace model where the primary authentication need is for service providers (consultants) to register and list their businesses. End users (companies seeking Brexit compliance help) appear to use the platform without requiring authentication, focusing instead on finding and contacting consultants through the directory interface.

The "List Your Business" link serves as the main authentication gateway, likely leading to a comprehensive business registration and verification process for consultants wanting to join the platform.
