# GitHub Actions Fix Applied ✅

## Problem Identified
The GitHub Actions workflows were running Playwright tests but missing the `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` environment variable. This caused tests to fail because they were trying to connect to `localhost:3000` (which doesn't exist in the CI environment).

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `.github/workflows/deploy-vercel.yml`
Added `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL: https://FindBrexitConsultants.co.uk` to the test environment variables:

```yaml
- name: Run Playwright tests
  run: pnpm exec playwright test
  continue-on-error: true
  env:
    PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL: https://FindBrexitConsultants.co.uk  # ← ADDED THIS LINE
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.VITE_SUPABASE_URL }}
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}
    VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: ${{ secrets.VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY }}
```

### 2. Updated `.github/workflows/deploy-hostinger.yml`
Made the same change to ensure both workflows use the production URL for testing:

```yaml
- name: Run Playwright tests
  run: pnpm exec playwright test
  continue-on-error: true
  env:
    PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL: https://FindBrexitConsultants.co.uk  # ← ADDED THIS LINE
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.VITE_SUPABASE_URL }}
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}
    VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: ${{ secrets.VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY }}
```

## How This Fixes GitHub Actions
- ✅ **Before**: Tests tried to connect to `localhost:3000` and failed in CI
- ✅ **After**: Tests now run against `https://FindBrexitConsultants.co.uk` in CI
- ✅ **Environment Variable Solution**: Now properly implemented for both local and CI environments

## Files Changed
- `.github/workflows/deploy-vercel.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-hostinger.yml`

## Next Steps
These changes need to be committed and pushed to trigger the updated GitHub Actions workflow.
