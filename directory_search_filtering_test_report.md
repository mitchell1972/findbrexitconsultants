## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Fix Contact Button Issue:** Contact buttons should navigate to a contact form or consultant-specific contact page, not redirect to homepage

### Medium Priority  
2. **Add Industry Filters:** Consider implementing Food & Beverage, Manufacturing, and other industry filters as searchable options
3. **Add Special Option Filters:** Consider adding "Verified consultants only" and "Free consultation" as filter checkboxes

### Low Priority
4. **Filter Panel UX:** Consider adding visual feedback when filters are applied (e.g., active state styling)

---

## Conclusion

The Directory Search & Filtering functionality is robust and working well overall. The core search capabilities, filtering system, and user interface are professional and functional. The single critical issue with Contact buttons should be addressed to ensure users can successfully connect with consultants. The missing industry and special option filters are enhancements that could improve the search experience but don't prevent core functionality.

**Overall Grade: B+** (Would be A- if Contact buttons worked correctly)
