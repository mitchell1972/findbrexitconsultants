# Brexit Consultants Website Research Report

## Task Summary
**Objective**: Navigate to https://findbrexit-consultants.vercel.app to locate and test the business registration form validation by clicking submit without filling fields.

**Result**: Unable to complete task due to website unavailability.

## Findings

### Website Status
- **URL**: https://findbrexit-consultants.vercel.app/
- **Status**: **404 NOT FOUND Error**
- **Error Type**: DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND
- **Deployment ID**: iad1::bpgmd-1756283191438-c0577645b9ef

### Error Details
The website displays a standard 404 error page with the following information:
- **Error Code**: DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND
- **Message**: "This deployment cannot be found"
- **Documentation Link**: https://vercel.com/docs/errors/platform-error-codes#deployment_not_found

### Research Limitations Encountered
1. **Primary Blocker**: The website deployment is not available or has been removed
2. **Impact**: Cannot access any website content, navigation, or business registration forms
3. **Alternative Sources**: No alternative URLs or mirror sites identified for this specific Brexit consultants service

## Visual Documentation
- Screenshot captured showing the complete 404 error page
- Full page content extracted and documented
- Error page contains only basic error information and a link to Vercel's documentation

## Recommendations
1. **Verify URL**: Confirm the correct website URL with the source that provided this link
2. **Check Alternative Sources**: Look for the service on other domains or platforms
3. **Contact Information**: If this was a legitimate business, search for their contact information through other channels
4. **Wait and Retry**: The deployment issue may be temporary - try accessing the site again later

## Technical Details
- **Platform**: Vercel deployment platform
- **Error Timestamp**: 2025-08-27 16:26:25 (when accessed)
- **Browser**: Successfully connected to URL but received server-side 404 error
- **Network**: No connectivity issues - this is a deployment availability issue

## Conclusion
The research task cannot be completed as requested because the target website (https://findbrexit-consultants.vercel.app) is currently unavailable with a "deployment not found" error. This appears to be a server-side issue where the website deployment has been removed or is experiencing technical difficulties.

To proceed with testing business registration form validation, an alternative working website URL would be needed.
