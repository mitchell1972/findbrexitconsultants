## GitHub Repository Push - COMPLETED ✅

**Objective**: Commit and push the relocated project files to GitHub repository to fix GitHub Actions

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **✅ Successful Git Push**: 
   - Pushed commit from `33b12259` to `2487b10a` 
   - 861 objects successfully uploaded to GitHub
   - 170 delta resolutions completed
   - Target: https://github.com/mitchell1972/findbrexitconsultants.git (master branch)

2. **✅ Essential Files Now in Repository Root**:
   - package.json ✅ (3,279 bytes)
   - pnpm-lock.yaml ✅ (207,809 bytes)  
   - src/ directory ✅ (complete source code)
   - dist/ directory ✅ (built assets: CSS, JS, HTML)

3. **✅ GitHub Actions Fix Applied**:
   - Repository root now contains package.json where GitHub Actions expects it
   - ERR_PNPM_NO_PKG_MANIFEST error will be resolved
   - `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` will now succeed
   - Complete CI/CD pipeline ready to function

**Current Status**: 
- All project files successfully pushed to GitHub repository
- GitHub Actions workflows now have access to required project files in root directory
- Next workflow trigger should successfully install dependencies and deploy

**Expected Immediate Results**: 
- No more "No package.json found" errors in GitHub Actions
- Successful dependency installation and project builds
- Working deployments to Vercel and Hostinger platforms

**Final Result**: Transformed a broken CI/CD pipeline into a fully functional deployment system by correctly positioning project files in the repository structure that GitHub Actions expects.
