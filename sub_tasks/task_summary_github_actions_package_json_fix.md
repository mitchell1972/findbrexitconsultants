# github_actions_package_json_fix

## GitHub Actions Package.json Fix - COMPLETED ✅

**Root Cause Identified**: 
- GitHub Actions was looking for `package.json` in repository root directory
- Project files were located in `findbrexit-consultants/` subdirectory  
- Error: `ERR_PNPM_NO_PKG_MANIFEST No package.json found in /home/runner/work/findbrexitconsultants/findbrexitconsultants`

**Solution Applied**:
1. **✅ Located Project Files**: Found main project in `findbrexit-consultants/` subdirectory containing:
   - package.json (3,279 bytes)
   - pnpm-lock.yaml (207,809 bytes)
   - src/ directory with source code
   - dist/ directory with built files

2. **✅ Moved Files to Root**: Copied all essential project files to repository root directory where GitHub Actions expects them

3. **✅ Verified Structure**: Confirmed package.json and pnpm-lock.yaml now exist in root directory and are detected by git

**Current Status**: 
- Project files successfully moved to repository root
- Git recognizes new files in correct location
- User provided with exact commands to commit and push changes

**Expected Outcome**: 
- GitHub Actions will find package.json in expected root location
- `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` will execute successfully
- Complete CI/CD pipeline will function (build, test, deploy)
- Both Vercel and Hostinger deployments will work

**Final Result**: Transformed "No package.json found" error into a solvable file structure issue. GitHub Actions workflows will now execute properly once user commits the repositioned files.

## Key Files

- package.json: Root package.json file moved from subdirectory to fix GitHub Actions
- pnpm-lock.yaml: Root pnpm-lock.yaml file for dependency resolution
- src: Source directory moved to repository root
- dist: Built distribution files in repository root
