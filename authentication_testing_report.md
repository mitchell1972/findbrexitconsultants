## Conclusion

The website is currently in a **pre-authentication phase** with no functional user authentication system. While the site effectively serves its primary function as a consultant directory for public browsing, the authentication infrastructure required for user accounts, consultant profiles, and platform management is not yet implemented. 

The development team should prioritize implementing a complete authentication system before launching user-centric features or marketing campaigns that require user registration.
