## Issues Identified

### Critical Issue 1: Backend API Error
**Error Type:** HTTP 400 - Bad Request  
**System:** Supabase Authentication API  
**Error Code:** `email_address_invalid`  
**Details:** The backend authentication system rejected the email address "test@example.com" as invalid, despite it being a properly formatted email address.

**Console Error Details:**
```
Error: supabase.api.non200
Status: 400
Error Code: email_address_invalid
API Endpoint: https://zjfilhbczaquokqlcoej.supabase.co/auth/v1/signup
```

### Critical Issue 2: Frontend Validation Error
**Error Type:** Password validation mismatch  
**Display:** Red borders on both password fields with error message  
**Message:** "Must be at least 6 characters"  
**Issue:** The password "password123" contains 11 characters, which exceeds the 6-character minimum, yet the validation error is still displayed.

## Technical Analysis

### Backend Issues:
1. **Email Validation:** The Supabase backend is incorrectly rejecting the test email "test@example.com" as invalid
2. **API Response:** Proper error handling is in place, but the validation logic appears faulty

### Frontend Issues:
1. **Password Validation Logic:** Frontend validation shows incorrect error message for password length
2. **Error State Synchronization:** Frontend and backend validation errors don't align properly

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Needed:
1. **Fix Backend Email Validation:** Review and correct the email validation logic in the Supabase authentication system
2. **Fix Frontend Password Validation:** Correct the password length validation logic to properly evaluate character count
3. **Improve Error Handling:** Ensure frontend validation errors match backend validation responses
4. **User Experience:** Provide clearer, more accurate error messages to users

### Testing Recommendations:
1. **Email Testing:** Test with various email formats to identify the exact email validation criteria
2. **Password Testing:** Test with different password lengths and complexities
3. **Integration Testing:** Ensure frontend and backend validations are synchronized
4. **Cross-browser Testing:** Verify form behavior across different browsers

## Summary

The sign-up process testing revealed significant issues with both frontend and backend validation systems. While the form structure and basic functionality work correctly, the validation logic contains critical bugs that prevent successful account creation. The issues identified would significantly impact user experience and require immediate attention from the development team.

**Status:** ❌ Sign-up process currently non-functional due to validation errors
