## Functionality Status Matrix

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Consultant Registration | ❌ Not Implemented | "Coming Soon" message |
| Profile Creation/Editing | ❌ Cannot Test | Registration blocked |
| Dashboard Access | ❌ Cannot Test | Registration blocked |
| Profile Display | ❌ Broken | All profiles show "not found" |

| Navigation | ✅ Working | Site navigation functional |

## Testing Limitations

Due to the non-functional registration system, the following features **could not be tested**:
- Consultant dashboard interfaces
- Profile editing capabilities
- Service/pricing management tools
- Analytics or performance metrics
- Notification systems
- Quote management features
- Verification processes
- Payment/commission management
- Any authenticated consultant features

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Implement consultant registration form** with proper backend integration
2. **Fix consultant profile page routing** to display existing consultant details
3. **Repair contact system** to enable consultant-specific communication
4. **Resolve Supabase API configuration** issues causing form submission failures

### Future Development:
- Once registration is working, implement comprehensive dashboard functionality
- Add profile editing capabilities for existing consultants
- Develop quote management and messaging systems
- Implement verification and payment processing features

## Conclusion

While the platform shows a solid foundation with working directory, search, and filtering functionality, **core consultant-facing features are not yet accessible** due to implementation gaps. The existing consultant data suggests the backend structure exists, but frontend integration and user authentication systems need completion before consultant functionality can be properly tested and utilized.
