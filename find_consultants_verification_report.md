Conducted comprehensive testing of the Find Consultants directory page at https://rcb8qrdqfcrj.space.minimax.io/find-consultants to verify proper listing of all 6 real consultants and functionality of search/filter systems.

## Key Findings

### ✅ All 6 Real Consultants Properly Listed

**Complete Directory Confirmed:**
- **Charles Burke** - UK Government Scotland - International Trade Division (Edinburgh, 2h response)
- **Dr Anna Jerzewska** - Trade & Borders Consultancy (London, 4h response)
- **Gwern Ifans** - Wales Trade Policy Advisory (Cardiff, 24h response)
- **Mary Meehan** - InterTradeIreland Business Solutions (Belfast, 6h response)
- **Rebecca Bermingham** - TRIUMPH International Trade Solutions (Birmingham, 8h response)
- **Chris Ashworth** - Northern Customs Solutions (Manchester, 12h response)

**Data Quality:**

- Complete profile information including locations, response times, experience, team sizes
- Functional "View Profile" and "Contact" buttons for each consultant
- Professional presentation with consistent formatting

## Functionality Testing Results

### ✅ Sorting Functionality - WORKING CORRECTLY

**Test Performed:** Changed sort from "Most Relevant" to "Fastest Response"
- **URL Change:** Added `?sortBy=response_time` parameter
- **Results:** Consultant order successfully changed to:
  1. Charles Burke (2h response)
  2. Dr Anna Jerzewska (4h response)  
  3. Mary Meehan (6h response)
- **Status:** ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

### ⚠️ Search Functionality - ISSUES IDENTIFIED

**Tests Performed:**
1. Search for "Dr Anna Jerzewska" → 0 results (❌ Should find 1 result)
2. Search for "Trade & Borders" → 0 results (❌ Should find 1 result)  
3. Empty search → Returns to all 6 consultants (✅ Working)

**Issues:**
- Search returns zero results for known consultant names and company names
- Search indexing appears to be broken or case-sensitive matching issues
- **Status:** ❌ **NOT FUNCTIONAL**

### ⚠️ Filter Functionality - PARTIALLY WORKING

**Filters Panel:** ✅ Opens correctly with comprehensive options
- **Service Type Filters:** Customs Declarations, VAT/Tax Compliance, Northern Ireland Protocol, Regulatory Compliance, Import/Export, Supply Chain Consulting
- **Location Filters:** London, Manchester, and more

**Location Filter Test:**
- **Filter Applied:** London checkbox selected
- **URL Change:** Added `locations=london` parameter  
- **Expected Result:** Should show only Dr Anna Jerzewska (London-based)
- **Actual Result:** Still shows all 6 consultants from all locations
- **Status:** ❌ **NOT FUNCTIONAL**

## Technical Implementation Status

### Working Features:
- ✅ Directory listing with proper consultant data
- ✅ Sorting functionality with URL parameter updates
- ✅ Filter panel UI and selection states
- ✅ Professional data presentation and formatting

### Problematic Features:
- ❌ Search functionality (returns 0 results for valid queries)
- ❌ Location filtering (doesn't filter results despite UI updates)
- ⚠️ Service type filtering (not tested due to location filter issues)

## Recommendations

1. **Search Functionality:**
   - Investigate search indexing implementation
   - Test case-sensitivity and partial matching
   - Verify database query logic

2. **Location Filtering:**
   - Check filter application logic
   - Verify database filtering queries
   - Test service type filters for similar issues

3. **Data Integrity:**
   - All consultant data is correctly stored and displayed
   - Continue with current professional presentation approach

## Conclusion
The directory successfully displays all 6 real consultants with proper formatting and data quality. However, critical search and filter functionality has implementation issues that prevent users from effectively finding specific consultants. The sorting feature works correctly, demonstrating the foundation is sound but requires fixes to search and filtering logic.
